### Contributions

During the Dune Archive System project, I was actively involved in all core aspects of the DBMS, including storage logic, validation, logging, documentation, and testing.

Key tasks I worked on include:

*   **Data Storage and Record Management**:
    *   Collaborated on the design and implementation of the page-based storage model, including file and page headers, slotted pages, and dynamic file creation.
    *   Helped develop and refine the functions for record insertion, searching, and deletion, ensuring correctness and efficiency.
    *   Worked on the encoding and decoding of records, handling both signed integers and fixed-length strings.

*   **Validation and Error Handling**:
    *   Contributed to the validation logic for type and field names, field counts, primary key indices, and duplicate field names.
    *   Helped implement robust error handling for all operations, including constraint violations, type mismatches, and file I/O errors.

*   **Logging and Output**:
    *   Helped develop the logging system to record every operation (success or failure) with timestamps in `log.csv`.
    *   Ensured that search results were correctly written to `output.txt` and that all edge cases were handled.

*   **Documentation and Testing**:
    *   Co-authored the `README.md` and `report.md` files, ensuring clear and comprehensive documentation.
    *   Designed and ran test input files to verify system behavior, including edge cases and invalid input.

*   **Collaboration**:
    *   Worked closely with my teammate, Bora Toprak Temir, to review code, debug issues, and ensure all system components were well-integrated.
    *   Participated in regular meetings to discuss design choices and resolve implementation challenges.

### Teamwork

We shared responsibilities across all features and reviewed each other's work frequently. Both of us contributed to the design, implementation, validation, and testing of the DBMS. Our teamwork ensured a robust and well-documented system.

### Self-Reflection

This project improved my understanding of file-based storage, binary data handling, and the importance of comprehensive validation and error handling. I learned how to design and debug a scalable storage system and gained valuable experience in collaborative software development.
